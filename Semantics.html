        <h1>My Daily Routine</h1>
        Each of us has a daily routine that we all follow. Similarly I also have a daily routine that I follow. It is simple and very effective and also makes me a very active child. Since there is a routine, it is easy and I am more systematic.
        This saves a lot of time also and thereby increases our productivity and keeps us healthy.
        I get up in the morning around 6.00 am. I pray and then begin my day. After the morning chores, I get ready to go to school. The uniform would be kept ready by my mom. I just need to wear them, get myself dressed full, comb my hair and get fully ready to go to school.
